=head1 NAME

Unwind::Protect - Run code after other code, even with exceptions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ++$depth;

    unwind_protect { unsafe_function() }
      after => sub { --$depth };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you need to run code after some other code. Two complications are
preserving list; scalar; or void context, and dealing with exceptions.
C<Unwind::Protect> handles both for you.

C<unwind-protect> exists in Common Lisp with nearly the same interface.

I strive to handle exceptions properly. It's not easy, because of all the tools
Perl provides. C<$SIG{__DIE__}> and C<caller> make this code somewhat hairy. If
you provide me a failing test where the C<unwind_protect> stack frame is
inadvertantly exposed, I will try to fix it.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 unwind_protect CODE, ARGS

C<unwind_protect> takes a code block (similar to C<grep>) then some named
arguments. Currently the only named argument that is accepted is C<after>
which is a coderef to run after the primary code.
